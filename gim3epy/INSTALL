The heart of gim3e for python is in gim3epy/core, in the gim3e module.  
There is a sample script, '01_run_gim3e_with_salmonella.py',
that implements gim3e and walks through some of the analysis that can be performed. 
 
To use gim3e for python, it is necessary to install:
   1) COBRApy 0.2.x 
   2) Ideally, one of these solvers should be used since they perform well with the gim3e MILP models:
      a. ILOG/CPLEX 12.5.0 or later (http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/optimization/cplex-optimizer/)
      b. gurobi 5.1 or later (http://gurobi.com)

EXPERIMENTAL: A sampler is included for the gim3e models, and its use is also demonstrated in the sample scripts.
The sampler has been tested with the included model of E. coli core metabolism, but is still in development since
it has not been extensively tested with the full genome-scale models.

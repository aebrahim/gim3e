Description: This package contains the Python distribution for GIM3E (Gene Inactivation Moderated by Metabolism, Metabolomics, and Expression), GIM3Epy. GIM3E is an algorithm that enables the development of condition-specific models based on a genome-scale model of metabolism, an objective function, transcriptomics, and cellular metabolomics data. GIM3E establishes metabolite utilization requirements with metabolomics data, uses model-paired transcriptomics data to find experimentally supported solutions, and also provides calculations of the turnover (production / consumption) flux of metabolites.
